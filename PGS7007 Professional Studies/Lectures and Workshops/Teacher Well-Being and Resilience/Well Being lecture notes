Staff Well-being is Key to School Success
This 2007 research paper by Rob Briner and Chris Dewberry explores the relationship between the well-being of school staff and school performance. The key takeaway is that there is a statistically significant positive correlation between teacher well-being and student performance, as measured by exam results (SATs and value-added measures). The study, which collected data from over 24,000 staff members in hundreds of primary and secondary schools, argues that while the impact may seem small, it is important because well-being is a factor that can be directly addressed and improved by the school system.
Resilience: Why Things Bounce Back
This book, published in 2012 by Andrew Zolli and Ann Marie Healy, defines resilience as the capacity of a system to maintain its core purpose and integrity in the face of dramatic change. They argue that in a world of constant disruption, we need to build "better shock absorbers." Their work is not just about individuals, but about how systems—from ecosystems to communities and organizations—can adapt, learn from failure, and bounce back stronger. The paper suggests that resilient systems are not about resisting change but about embracing it, and that they are often characterized by diversity, adaptability, and the ability to reorganize resources after a disruption.

She has also shown some books which are related to the wellbeing and also told us to complete a questionaire related to 
resilience https://www.gooddayatwork.co.uk/iresilience.aspx
